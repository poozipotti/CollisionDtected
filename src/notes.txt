What does research do:
allows buldings to be built
gives older buildings new features
speed up economy or research

overall game design goals:
Money can be used to speed up research but you must also use it for building

should research be able to speed up research signifigantly?
    the point of the game is risk and if this is the case than instead of taking risk

    every game will start out the same way, research should not speed up research
    but hidden bonuses may speed up other researches
    
    anyway what should the first research be (minimum viable product!!)
        giant space Ship!
            work from big to small
                
each research relies on several others, recurse through and find a failure and it will bubble up through
    example: didnt invest in farming -> people starve on generation ship -> ship arrives everyone dead
    example: telescope didn't fins  planet -> ship wanders endlessly -> your people become a strange 
            race of ship people doomed as their ship slowly fails. 

Big Ship-> FTL drive or Cryofreeze or Generation Ship  depending on what researches you have done, changes the nature of the ship
    FTL drive -> advanced energy management &
    Cryofreeze ->
    Generation Ship ->




Programming wise:
    researches are added as dependencies to other researches
        parent researches & Buildings hold depenencies
            Buildings hold scenarios (factory exploding people starving etc. and it will randomly roll a scenario and check to see if researches prevent it)
            no food in one game could be survival but everyone resorts to cannabilism or everyone dies before they arrive, make it fun!!
            
            Researches don't often fail, the are like building plans, but they will certain time (your sicentists cannot figure out how to hold enough fuel,
            tell them to keep trying to figure it out or make a new type of fuel(different research) keep trying
            is a random hidden value, it is a gamble...
